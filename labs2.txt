Thoughts:
	Tables Needed:
		Inventory
			Prices
		Sales:
			Receipt info
		Accounting:
			Upkeep
				Employee
				Supplies
			Revenue
Interactions: 
	Employees:
		Inventory
		Sales
	Managers:

	Inventory table would interact with sales table, to keep track of items in stock. The sales table would interact with the inventory table to know how much an item costs when a sale is made.
